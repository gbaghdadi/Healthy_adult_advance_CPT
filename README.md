Heathy adult data under an advance continuous performance test

This repository contains the reaction time of some adults under an advance integrated visual and auditory continuous performance test.
This test had 576 trials (two same blocks of 288 trials). 
In each trial, a target(number 1 in Persion)/non-target(number 2 in Persion) stimulus was presented visually (on left/right side of the screen) or auditory (into left/right ear).
In some trials, an auditory/visual distractor was presented simultaneously on the opposite side of the presented target/non-target stimulus. 

Distractors had the following conditions:
   - in some trials, the distractor was auditory and in some trials it was visual
   - in some trials, the distractor was somehow similar to the presented target/non-target stimulus
   - in some trials, the saliency of distractor was more than the presented target/non-target stimulus

In the excel file, which contains the reaction time values (zero values shows that the participant didn't have any reaction), there is a sheet titled "trial descripton".
This sheet shows the condition of the presented target/non-target stimulu and the distractor in each trial.
